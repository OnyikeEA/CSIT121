            <p>The Web Standards course has been very fascinating, arousing a feeling of both excitement and challenge. While it has been exciting to learn about the behind-the-scenes of designing and publishing a typical webpage, trying to make sense of the HTML structure and all the technical jargons contained therein has been very intimidating. It was not until I was able to publish my first webpage, that I began to understand and develop confidence in the course. <br>As I worked on my Lab 01 assignment, I learnt a very valuable lesson. I did not read the instruction correctly, so I downloaded my about-me file in my projects folder and uploaded to GitHub. By the time I realized the mistake, I did not know how to delete the file because I did not come across that in my reading assignment. However, I researched the solution on the internet and found that to delete a file on GitHub, you need to open the file on GitHub, click the three dots on the top right corner of the open file, then select delete file. I did just that and it worked. What a relief it was.</p>
