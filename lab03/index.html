        <h2>Modules 01 & 02</h2>
            <p>The Web Standards course has been very fascinating, arousing a feeling of both excitement and challenge. While it has been exciting to learn about the behind-the-scenes of designing and publishing a typical webpage, trying to make sense of the HTML structure and all the technical jargons contained therein has been very intimidating. It was not until I was able to publish my first webpage, that I began to understand and develop confidence in the course. <br>As I worked on my Lab 01 assignment, I learnt a very valuable lesson. I did not read the instruction correctly, so I downloaded my about-me file in my projects folder and uploaded to GitHub. By the time I realized the mistake, I did not know how to delete the file because I did not come across that in my reading assignment. However, I researched the solution on the internet and found that to delete a file on GitHub, you need to open the file on GitHub, click the three dots on the top right corner of the open file, then select delete file. I did just that and it worked. What a relief it was.</p>
        <h2>Module 03</h2>
        <p>According to w3schools.com(2024),<span class="quote">"CSS is the fashion designer of HTML."</span> I would argue that there is no better way to expalin the capabilities of CSS than this. It has been very fascinating learning how CSS can be used to style HTML, and exploring all the web design possibilities that it offers. I have been able to master quite a few things, such as styling elements based on "id" and "class", manipulating various text properties of elements. I am getting very familiar with CSS box rule, which expalains how HTML elements relate to the web page and each other.<br> One of the interesting features that I learnt is how to select and manipulate colors on CSS. Not only does CSS suggest various color options when trying to make a selection, which is very fantastic but also when you hover over any color, it opens up the color palette or pantone. This give you the flexiblity of creating any shade of color from a very wide spectrum. I really do think that that is very amazing.<br> Another interesting feature that I noticed on VS code is the icons at the bottom left corner of the page or wondow, which indicates if there errors with your code while also expalaining the solution to resolving the errors. I think that is very useful feature to have because even before validating your code, it gives you an idea of the quality of your code.</p>

            <h3>What I have Learned</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>how to use the live preview extension extension in the VS code. It is very invaluable. It makes it so easy to visualize my code in real time, see what the layout looks like, quickly identify and correct any grammatical errors in my work before even publising my HTML page.</li>
            <li>the Basic Tags, Common Page Construct, AKA Structural Elements. I am encouraged and have written a few codes. I can definitely say that seeing the codes come to life is really exciting!</li>
